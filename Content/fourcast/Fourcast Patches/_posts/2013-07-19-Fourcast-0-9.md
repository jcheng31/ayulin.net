Settings UI tweaks, architectural improvements, and bug fixes.

* Added the ability to view estimated forecasts.
    * These are for locations where Weather Underground has no weather station, indicated by "(Estimated)" in the station name.
* Made the buttons on the Settings page stretch to fit the entire page width.
    * Groundbreaking stuff.
* Changed the way in which the app handles and saves settings internally.
* Changed the Pick a Place error messages to be more friendly (though you hopefully won't have to see them.)
* Fixed an issue that would cause the keypad to appear after removing the Home Location.
* Fixed an issue that would cause the app to crash when searching for locations when on a WiFi network with browser-based login.
