A cleaner while still familiar main UI.

* No Forecast Loaded: No Forecast Loaded - No Forecast Loaded. **No more.**
    * Reduced the number of "No Forecast Loaded" messages that are displayed. 
        * It really doesn't need to be displayed thrice. 
            * Should've figured that one out earlier.
* Centred and capitalised the headers above each forecast element.
* Removed the "(Map)" link next to Station Names. Station maps can now be accessed by tapping the underlined name directly. 
    * Stations without a map will not have their names underlined.
* Removed the headers above the Station Name and Forecast Time labels.
* Removed the white borders around each forecast element.
