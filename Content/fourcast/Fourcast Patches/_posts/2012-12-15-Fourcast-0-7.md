Higher resolution tiles, backend architectural improvements, bug fixes, and optimisations.

* Improved the resolution of Live Tiles on WP7.8 and WP8 devices.
* Fixed an issue that could cause crashes when parsing weather in certain locales.
* Removed unnecessary reference to the Coding4Fun Audio toolkit. The app should no longer advertise a Microphone requirement that it doesn't need or use. (Oops.)
* Improved the way in which Conditions are parsed and labelled.
* Reorganised and refactored large portions of the backend.
