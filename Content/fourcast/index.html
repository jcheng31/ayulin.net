				<h1>Changelog</h1>

					<h2>v1.0 - 26 November 2013 <small>"Window cleaning."</small></h2>
					<p>A cleaner while still familiar main UI.</p>

											</ul>
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Centred and capitalised the headers above each forecast element.</li>
