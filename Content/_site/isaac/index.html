		<h3>Well, kind of.</h3>

		<h2 class = "nomargin">What is ISAAC?</h2>
		<p>ISAAC is a star system simulator, with a force-based physics engine at its heart.</p>

		<h2 class = "nomargin">A what?</h2>
		<p>ISAAC's core layer approximates the way objects move, based on the forces acting upon them.</p>
		<p>It's based entirely around two formulae.</p>
		<div>
			<ol class = "nocentre">
				<li>F = ma (Force is Mass multiplied by Acceleration)</li>
				<li>v = u + at (Current Velocity is Previous Velocity plus Acceleration multiplied by Time)</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>
			We calculate an object's acceleration based on its mass and the force acting upon it,</br>
			calculate its velocity	based on its acceleration, </br>
			then calculate a new position for the object based on its velocity.
		</p>

		<h2 class = "nomargin">Okay. What's this about the Solar System, then?</h2>
		<p>ISAAC can simulate star systems given a simple set of specifications. So we built a model of the Solar System with it.</p>
		<p>Change the Gravitational Constant. Fiddle with the mass of things. See how things react.</p>
