Architectural improvements, and a new way of getting weather data.

* Switched from using Weather Underground's XML API to their JSON one.
    * This doesn't affect functionality, though it does bring a very small reduction in data usage.
    * Another side effect: the "Root element is missing" issue should no longer occur.
* Rewrote the way the app stores, handles, and retrieves settings.
* Fixed an issue involving Live Tiles for locations with "/" in their names.
