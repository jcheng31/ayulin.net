description: Another trip, another animal.

Though it wasn't an actual objective, each of our last few trips has resulted in coming home with a new plush animal. 

Our visit to Fukuoka net the little chick that became my profile pic almost everywhere (and which adorns the sidebar here). San Francisco resulted in a [fuzzy shark](http://t.co/rlmaZh7Z).

London brought this guy.

It barely counts as an animal - a red ball with eyes, a nose, and two antlers - but it was cute enough. Technically it's a washball (or towelling sponge), and, as the label says, "not a toy".
