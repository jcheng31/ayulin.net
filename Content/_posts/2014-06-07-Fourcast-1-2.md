Another UI redesign, and long-overdue improvements to tiles.

* **The forecast display has been redesigned.**
	* The weather station name and map link is now above the forecast pivot.
	* Each forecast element is now laid out horizontally, and their headers have been removed.
	* Icons have been added for each state: hot/warm/cold/cool, clear/obscured/rain/snow, windy/still, and humid/arid.
* **Live tiles have been redesigned.**
	* Tiles will appear the same on Windows Phone 7.5 and below, but with the new condition icons used instead.
	* Windows Phone 7.8 and 8 users will now see all four pieces of forecast information on the tile: temperature, condition, humidity, and wind speed.
* **The "tonight" pivot has been renamed to "today".**
	* This more accurately reflects the nature of the forecast information displayed there; the actual data displayed has not been changed.
* **The splash screen has been removed.**
	* The app should take less time to launch now.
* **Rewrote the city/location search function.**
	* As a side-effect, searching while a search is already in progress no longer crashes the app.
