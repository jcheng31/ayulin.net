I dropped by the UWCSEA Dover Campus earlier to visit the alumni office. Passing by the English block, it became clear there were some... *changes*.

Some of the pieces were bidding the block goodbye.

There was even a [doge](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/doge) reference.

I'm guessing the English block's getting torn down or otherwise renovated in the way the Maths block was, and students were allowed to tag it up before it was closed off entirely. That's pretty cool on the school's part.

Unless students *weren't* in fact allowed to do this, in which case... wow, that's daring of them.

The alumni office was right on the border with U Town, and revealed the reason I kept seeing students in uniform there:

A back gate. Mystery solved.
