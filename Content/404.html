	<h1>Oops.</h1>
	<p>There's nothing at the URL you're looking for.</p>

	<p>If you came here via a link, you were probably being directed to a blog post which has been moved - the permalink structure changed a while ago, and I haven't figured out a graceful redirect solution. Sorry!</p>

	<p>You can get to my blog <a href="/blog">here</a>, or to the main site <a href="/">here.</a></p>

	<p>You could also try searching for the post you're looking for below.</p>
