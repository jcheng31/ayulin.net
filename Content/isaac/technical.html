		<h3>A look at the stuff that makes ISAAC work.</h3>

		<h2 class = "nomargin">What's ISAAC made of?</h2>
		<p>Lots of code, really. Oh, and a few textures.</p>

		<p>Graphics are handled by the excellent <a href="http://mrdoob.github.com/three.js/">three.js</a> library.</p>

		<p>Planet textures came from <a href = "http://planetpixelemporium.com/planets.html">JHT's Planetary Pixel Emporium</a>.</p>

		<p>Planet data (initial positions and velocities) was taken from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's <a href = "http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?horizons">HORIZONS</a> system.</p>

		<p>The GUI uses <a href = "http://code.google.com/p/dat-gui/">dat.GUI</a>.</p>

		<p>ISAAC itself is written in plain old vanilla JavaScript.</p>

		<h2 class = "nomargin">More details!</h2>
		<p>
			ISAAC uses HTML5's Canvas element (or more accurately, three.js does) to render graphics.</br>
			We use three.js' WebGL renderer if we detect your browser supports it, but fall back to the Canvas renderer if not. Several graphical features are also disabled in the Canvas renderer.
		</p>
		<p>
			Physics calculations are done at a rate of 60 "ticks" per second, separate from the actual display frame rate.</br>
			It's OK if the display frame rate is less than 60 FPS - planets are rendered at the latest position calculated.
		</p>
		<p>
			We use HTML5 Web Workers to push physics calculation to its own thread. Unfortunately, ISAAC won't work if your browser doesn't support these - you'll still see the Solar System, but none of the planets will move.</br>
		</p>

		<h2 class = "nomargin">What <i>exactly</i> can I do in ISAAC?</h2>
		<h3 class = "nomargin">AKA: features.</h3>
		<p>
			We simulate the gravitational force between all the planets - they aren't just affected solely by the Sun.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can pan the camera around by clicking and dragging the mouse. Click on a planet to jump to it, and zoom in and out by holding the middle mouse button down and dragging the mouse. Alternatively, you can choose a planet and zoom level manually from the GUI.
		</p>
		<p>
			The mass of each and every planet you see can be adjusted. Use the slider in the corresponding planet's menu.
		</p>
		<p>
			The gravitational constant itself can be played with - use the slider in the Simulation Settings menu.
		</p>
		<p>
			Things moving a little too slowly? Speed time up with the Days Per Second slider in Simulation Settings.
